# bookingNotifications

## Who should use this?
Anyone who uses Booking.com to reserve hotels and doesn't want to miss the cancellation window

### Assumes that you:
1. Use booking.com to book hotels that allow for cancellations
2. Have booking.com confirmation emails sent to your gmail address
3. Use Google Calendar and receive notifications

This works by scanning your email for booking.com confirmations, 
then creating calendar events 48 hours before a booking needs to be cancelled. 
It emails you every time a calendar event is created to confirm successful operation. 

Do not solely rely on this for tracking your confirmations! 

This is simply one additional method to keep track.
